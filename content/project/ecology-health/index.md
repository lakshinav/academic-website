## Abstract
The purpose of the study is to analyze influence of environmental factors on health of children aged 0 to 14 years exemplified by the Nizhny Novgorod region. The object of modeling was incidence rate in children aged 0 to 14 in 50 municipalities of the Nizhny Novgorod region in 2000-2016.
The study used methods of econometric analysis, including panel regression with fixed and random effects, as well as Wooldridge tests for the unobserved effects and Darbin-Woo-Hausman for the regressionsâ€™ diagnostics. Calculations were carried out on the basis of the data of the Nizhny Novgorod Statistics Service and Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation.
Results of the model estimation suggest a statistically significant effect of the considered factors on the level of the pediatric incidence rate. Factors that have a significant impact on health of the younger generation include availability of pediatricians and district doctors providing outpatient primary health care to children aged 0-14; current expenditures on environmental protection; proportion of unpurified emissions in the total amount of pollutants discarded from the stationary sources; emissions of pollutants into atmosphere from the stationary sources; number of water samples analyzed according to sanitary-chemical indicators taken from sources of the centralized water supply with a breakdown on districts, that do not meet the sanitary standards. <par> This research is supported by the Russian Fund for Basic Research, grant number 18-010-00632.
