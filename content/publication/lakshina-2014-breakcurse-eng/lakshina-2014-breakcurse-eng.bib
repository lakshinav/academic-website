 abstract = {The article is devoted to the estimation of multivariate volatility of a portfolio consisted from twenty American stocks. The six specifications of multivariate volatility models are formulated and estimated. Itâ€™s demonstrated that spatial specifications of multivariate volatility models allow not only reduce the dimension of the problem, but in some cases outdo original specifications at in-sample and out-of-sample comparison.},
