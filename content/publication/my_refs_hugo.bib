	abstract={The article is devoted to the estimation of multivariate volatility of a portfolio consisted from twenty American stocks. The six specifications of multivariate volatility models are formulated and estimated. It’s demonstrated that spatial specifications of multivariate volatility models allow not only reduce the dimension of the problem, but in some cases outdo original specifications at in-sample and out-of-sample comparison.},

    abstract={The paper proposes the thorough investigation of in-sample and out-of-sample performance of five GARCH and two stochastic volatility models, estimated on the Russian financial data. The data includes prices of Aeroflot and Gazprom stocks and Ruble against US dollar exchange rates. In our analysis we use probability integral transform for in-sample comparison and Mincer-Zarnowitz regression along with classical forecast performance measures for out-of-sample comparison. Studying both the explanatory and the forecasting power of the considered models we came to the conclusion that stochastic volatility models perform equally or in some cases better than GARCH models.}

    abstract={The paper studies the problem of dynamic hedge ratio calculation for the portfolio consisted of two assets – futures and the underlying stock. We apply the utility based approach to account for the degree of risk aversion in the hedging strategy. Seventeen portfolios, consisted of Russian blue-chip stocks and futures, are estimated in the paper. In order to estimate the conditional covariances of hedged portfolio returns, such multivariate volatility models as GO-GARCH, copula-GARCH, asymmetric DCC and parsimonious stochastic volatility model are applied. The hedging efficiency is estimated on the out-of-sample period using the maximum attainable risk reduction, the financial result and the investor’s utility. It’s shown that for 60% of portfolios ADCC surpasses the other models in hedging. Including the degree of risk aversion in the investor’s utility function together with above-mentioned volatility models allows to reach hedging efficiency of 88%.}
